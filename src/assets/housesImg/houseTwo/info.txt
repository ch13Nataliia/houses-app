        This guesthouse is nicer than the average home but also smaller than the
        average home at just 600 sq ft! Designed by Eric Shepherd Architects,
        this custom home serves as a guesthouse in one lucky's California
        family's backyard. The guesthouse is styled to match the main house for
        consistency, creating an overall flawless home design. Inside are high,
        vaulted ceilings with a full kitchen, living room, bedroom, and
        bathroom. There's also a front porch and lush greenery surrounding the
        home. Beautiful, isn't it?
